A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is an entity with no central leadership. Decisions get made from the bottom-up, governed by a community organized around a specific set of rules enforced on a blockchain.

DAOs are internet-native organizations that are collectively owned and managed by their members. They have built-in treasuries that no one has the authority to access without the approval of the group.

### Examples of DAOs

*   **MakerDAO**
*   **Uniswap**
*   **The DAO**
