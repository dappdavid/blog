Decentralized applications (dApps) are applications that run on a P2P network of computers rather than a single computer.

## What makes a dApp?

1.  **Open Source:** The source code is intentionally made available to the public.
2.  **Decentralized:** Data and records of operation must be cryptographically stored in a public, decentralized blockchain.
3.  **Incentivized:** Validators of the blockchain are incentivized by rewarding them with cryptographic tokens.
4.  **Protocol:** The application community must agree on a cryptographic algorithm to show proof of value.

The future looks bright for dApps as they offer transparency, reliability, and flexibility.
